        <p>Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task running, 
            and version control. It aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug cycle and leaves
             more complex workflows to fuller featured IDEs, such as Visual Studio IDE. It is very simple to use at the baseline of
             coding, whatever it may be.

                The console is used to check if a certain code is working. It can be entered in Javascript with this command: 
                console.log()
            </p>
            <script> 
            var first = "Ranbir";
            var last = "Kapoor";    
            var full = first.concat(last)
            console.log(full)
            var a = 10;
            var b = 5;
            var add = a + b;
            console.log(add)
        
            </script>
